**2020 Data Representation Project**
 
***********************************************
<p align="justify">This repository contains my project which will look 


This project is for the Data Representation Moudule at GMIT.
I commenced work on ?? November 2020 and completed the task by the due date.

I struggeld in the early days of the project trying to get python scripts to work correctly. This kinda put me off the project a bit initially.  I kept putting off this project because of my difficutlies at the early stage until I decided on a strategy to over come this and meet the deadline.  I have completed it although it maybe a bit basic. 

From completeing this project and overcoming my initial difficulties, in creating python scripts, I can see that when creating any project of this nature, you must take small steps and work from the basis up. When you can get one or two simple things to work you can build on them to create a more advanced script.</p>
